# Project 2

## Overview


## Task 2

The de Casteljau algorithm can be extended to Bezier surfaces by finding the single point for every row of control points, and then finding the final point for the surface using all the calculated points. Essentially, you run the algorithm for every row of control points. This will give you a list of new points, which you can run the algorithm on once more to get the final, single point for the nxn surface.
